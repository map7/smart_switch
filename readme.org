   Plugin your arduino smart switch
   
   Find out your device info (assuming it's on /dev/ttyUSB0 at the moment).
   : udevadm info -a -p  $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/ttyUSB0)
   
   Enter a rule in /lib/udev/rules.d/60-persistent-iot.rules
   : ACTION=="add", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d6b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0002", SYMLINK+="smart_switch"
   (Change 1d6b and 0002 with your idVendor and idProduct)
   
    Now replug in your smart switch and it should have a symlink as /dev/smart_switch. This is what is used in this program.

2. Add your user to dialout group
   Edit the /etc/group and add your user then relogin.

3. Start rails server
   : rails s -b 10.1.1.10
